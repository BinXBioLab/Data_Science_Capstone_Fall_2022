# Setting Up
Most files that will be needed are contained within the repository. The only files that are not contained within the repository are those files in `raw_data/Pasca_scRNAseq/inter/`. They are not included because they are too large to commit to GitHub via normal means and we lack adequate storage space and bandwidth on git lfs (Git Large-file Storage). However, these files are also generated via running the pipeline so they are not strictly necessary for running the code from scratch. A `git clone` should be sufficient to get started. If you have access to the Google Drive folder with the data that belongs in `raw_data/Pasca_scRNAseq/inter/`, go ahead and copy it there. The files in there will automatically be ignored via the `.gitignore` file so any changes to them will not be tracked. This may change in the future but it is unlikely due to the extremely large nature of the files (>16 Gb).
